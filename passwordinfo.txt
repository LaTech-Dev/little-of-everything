Yes, you can set up a simple password protection system using HTML and JavaScript to control access to a local text file (e.g., myfile.txt) on your Mac. However, there are some important limitations and things to be aware of:

🔐 What You Can Do (Simplified Approach)

You can:

Prompt for a password using JavaScript.

If the password is correct, load and display the local .txt file inside the HTML page.

⚠️ What You Can't (or Shouldn't) Do

You cannot fully secure a file with just HTML/JavaScript — because all the code (including the password) can be viewed in the browser’s developer tools.

You cannot access arbitrary local files directly unless you allow the browser to do so — for security reasons.

✅ Simple Demo: HTML + JavaScript (Password + Local File Access Prompt)

Create a folder on your Mac (say, SecureViewer) and put two files in it:

index.html (the main HTML file)

secret.txt (the text file you want to display if the password is correct)

📄 index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Password Protected Text Viewer</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h2>Enter Password to View File</h2>
  <input type="password" id="passwordInput" placeholder="Enter password">
  <button onclick="checkPassword()">Submit</button>
  
  <div id="fileContent" style="margin-top:20px; white-space: pre-wrap;"></div>

  <script>
    const correctPassword = "mypassword"; // CHANGE THIS to your desired password

    function checkPassword() {
      const entered = document.getElementById("passwordInput").value;
      if (entered === correctPassword) {
        // Load the file
        fetch('secret.txt')
          .then(response => {
            if (!response.ok) {
              throw new Error('File not found');
            }
            return response.text();
          })
          .then(data => {
            document.getElementById("fileContent").textContent = data;
          })
          .catch(error => {
            document.getElementById("fileContent").textContent = 'Error loading file: ' + error;
          });
      } else {
        alert("Incorrect password.");
      }
    }
  </script>
</body>
</html>

📄 secret.txt

Put anything you want in here. This is your protected text.

🧪 How to Use

Open index.html in a browser on your Mac (e.g., drag it into Safari or Chrome).

Enter the correct password (mypassword by default).

It will fetch and display secret.txt.

🔒 How to Make It Slightly More Secure

This method is very basic. To improve security (but still local-only), consider:

Obfuscating the JS (but it’s still viewable in DevTools).

Running a local server (e.g., using Python or Node.js) and managing authentication server-side.

Using file-level encryption tools on macOS (like encrypting the .txt file with Disk Utility).
